Part II:

Read the integrated encoder

Run the motor for 5 seconds
Using command structures, run the motor forwards for 2 seconds and then backwards for 2 seconds
Run the motor until it is past 10000 native units read from the integrated encoder

Part III:
Create another subsystem with a second motor and create a command to run that motor

Run both motors at the same time for 5 seconds

Run both motors at the same time until the first motor goes past 10000 native units
